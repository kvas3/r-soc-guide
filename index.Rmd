# About

Welcome to this guide! We, Vas (c/o 2021) and Daniel (c/o 2022), are two
sociology alumni from Santa Clara. One of the highlights of our time in
the department was our RAship with Dr. Molly King. We loved our time
learning R under Prof. King's guidance and are excited to pass on our
learnings to support future RAs with their research. We hope this guide
will help you get excited and set-up to conduct sociological analyses in
R!

## Why you should learn R

R is a free, open-source statistical software. It's widely used in
academia & research and is also used in many industries for data
analysis, visualization, and GIS. If you don't know other
programming/coding languages yet, R is a great primer as it translates
well to Python and will help you develop data science and computational
social science skills. Because R is open-source, it makes our scientific
pursuits of reproducibility, transparency, and open science much easier.
Last but not least, there is a large community of users and developers
who contribute to improving R, so it's *very* likely that other users
have already encountered the errors and roadblocks that might line your
path as you learn this language.

## Usage

This guide will set you up to conduct research with Dr. King in R, but
it assumes some basic knowledge of R. Here are some resources to
familiarize yourself with R syntax before you use our guide. You don't
have to go through all of them, but pick 1-2 to get started.

-   [Hands-on Programming with
    R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) (book; see appendix
    for R installation instructions)
-   [Impatient
    R](https://www.burns-stat.com/documents/tutorials/impatient-r/)
    (quick written tutorial)
-   Self-paced workshops by UC Berkeley's D-Lab

### Notes

Vas and Daniel started learning R in 2020, and this guide was last
updated in 2023. R is a powerful language, so there is all sorts of
analysis you can leverage it for. To name a few, spatial research (e.g.,
mapping and GIS), textual analysis, and network analysis can all be
performed using R. This guide covers one small part: survey analysis,
specifically, analysis of large-scale survey data that is weighted.
Fortunately, the datasets we worked with during our RAships with Dr.
King had already been meticulously cleaned, but it's possible you'll
have to clean and tidy data on your own. We hope the resources above can
help you get started here.

R is open-source, so this means there are always new updates and
features added to the software to ensure that it keeps up with the
times. It's possible that some of the code in this guide (or content in
the resources listed above) is outdated. With a little
googling, you should be able find tons of other learning materials
online. You're always welcome to email
vasudha.037\@gmail.com with questions, corrections, or other musings.
